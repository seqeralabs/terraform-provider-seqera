# ==============================================================================
# WORKSPACES RESOURCE OVERLAY
# ==============================================================================
#
# Workspaces provide isolated environments for organizing pipelines, compute
# environments, credentials, and data. Each user has a personal workspace, and
# organizations can create multiple shared workspaces with fine-grained access
# control for collaborative research projects.
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# -------------
# - Workspaces belong to organizations and must reference an org_id
# - User workspaces: Personal workspaces for individual users
# - Organization workspaces: Shared workspaces with team-based access control
# - Participants: Members or teams with specific roles in a workspace
# - Visibility: Controls whether workspace is private, shared, or public
#
# WORKSPACE RELATIONSHIPS:
# ------------------------
# Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.
# Organization workspaces extend user workspace functionality by adding the
# ability to fine-tune access levels for specific members, collaborators, or
# teams through participant management.
#
# TERRAFORM EXAMPLES:
# -------------------
#
# Example 1: Basic workspace
# resource "seqera_workspace" "basic" {
#   org_id    = seqera_orgs.my_org.id
#   name      = "genomics-research"
#   full_name = "Genomics Research Workspace"
# }
#
# Example 2: Workspace with visibility and description
# resource "seqera_workspace" "research" {
#   org_id      = seqera_orgs.my_org.id
#   name        = "genomics-research"
#   full_name   = "Genomics Research Workspace"
#   description = "Workspace for genomics research projects and computational biology workflows"
#   visibility  = "SHARED"
# }

        Manage workspaces for organizing projects and resources.

        Workspaces provide isolated environments for organizing pipelines,
        compute environments, and data, with configurable permissions
        and access controls for collaborative research projects.

        Each user has a unique user workspace to manage resources such as pipelines,
        compute environments, and credentials. You can also create multiple workspaces within
        an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users,
        while providing fine-grained access control for each of the teams.

        Organization workspaces extend the functionality of user workspaces by adding
        the ability to fine-tune access levels for specific members, collaborators, or teams.
        This is achieved by managing participants in the organization workspaces.

        Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.
