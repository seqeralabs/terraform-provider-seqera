  Manage workspace participant access in Seqera Platform.
  Workspace participants are users or teams who have been granted access to a
  specific workspace within an organization. Participants can have granular
  roles (owner, admin, maintain, launch, connect, view) that determine their
  permissions within the workspace.
  Participants can be added by username/email, or by referencing an existing
  organization member ID or team ID. This enables flexible access control at
  the workspace level.
