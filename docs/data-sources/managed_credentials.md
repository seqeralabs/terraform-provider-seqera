  Manage individual user SSH credentials for HPC Managed Identities.
  Managed Credentials are user-specific SSH credentials that link to a
  parent Managed Identity. Each credential contains a Linux username and
  SSH private key, enabling individual user authentication to HPC systems
  while maintaining separate user identity in system logs.
  This allows workspace users to access HPC environments with their own
  credentials rather than shared SSH keys, ensuring proper activity tracking,
  fair resource allocation through HPC queue policies, and appropriate
  access control based on individual Linux user permissions.
  Note: All users must belong to the same Linux group with access to the
  HPC work directory for proper file sharing and permissions.

# seqera_managed_credentials (Data Source)

Manage individual user SSH credentials for HPC Managed Identities.

Managed Credentials are user-specific SSH credentials that link to a
parent Managed Identity. Each credential contains a Linux username and
SSH private key, enabling individual user authentication to HPC systems
while maintaining separate user identity in system logs.

This allows workspace users to access HPC environments with their own
credentials rather than shared SSH keys, ensuring proper activity tracking,
fair resource allocation through HPC queue policies, and appropriate
access control based on individual Linux user permissions.

Note: All users must belong to the same Linux group with access to the
HPC work directory for proper file sharing and permissions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "seqera_managed_credentials" "my_managedcredentials" {
  managed_identity_id = 10
  max                 = 7
  offset              = 5
  org_id              = 10
  search              = "...my_search..."
  user_id             = 5
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `managed_identity_id` (Number) Parent Managed Identity numeric identifier
- `org_id` (Number) Organization numeric identifier

### Optional

- `max` (Number) Pagination max results
- `offset` (Number) Pagination offset
- `search` (String) Optional filtering on Managed Credentials for the given Managed Identity: Allows free text search on `userName` or `firstName + lastName`. Accepts keywords: `is:missing` or `is:added` to filter on credentials status. If not provided (or both provided), all are returned.
- `user_id` (Number) User numeric identifier to filter records by

### Read-Only

- `credential_provider` (String) Credential provider type (currently only SSH)
- `managed_credentials_id` (Number) Managed Credentials numeric identifier
- `total_size` (Number)
- `user_name` (String) Username for SSH authentication
