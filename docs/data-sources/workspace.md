# seqera_workspace (Data Source)

Manage workspaces for organizing projects and resources.

Workspaces provide isolated environments for organizing pipelines,
compute environments, and data, with configurable permissions
and access controls for collaborative research projects.

Each user has a unique user workspace to manage resources such as pipelines,
compute environments, and credentials. You can also create multiple workspaces within
an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users,
while providing fine-grained access control for each of the teams.

Organization workspaces extend the functionality of user workspaces by adding
the ability to fine-tune access levels for specific members, collaborators, or teams.
This is achieved by managing participants in the organization workspaces.

Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.

## Example Usage

  id          = 1
  name        = "genomics-research"
  org_id      = 7
}
```
