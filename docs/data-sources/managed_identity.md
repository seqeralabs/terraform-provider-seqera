# seqera_managed_identity (Data Source)

Manage Managed Identities for HPC environments in Seqera Platform.

Managed Identities are organization-level credentials for HPC/grid computing
platforms that enable granular access control for individual workspace users.
Unlike shared SSH credentials where all activities appear under one account,
managed identities link multiple user credentials to a single identity,
preserving each user's identity in system logs and enabling fair resource
allocation through HPC queue policies.

Supported platforms: Altair PBS, IBM LSF, Moab, Slurm, and Univa Grid Engine.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "seqera_managed_identity" "my_managedidentity" {
  managed_identity_id = 1
  org_id              = 8
}
```
