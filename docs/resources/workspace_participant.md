# seqera_workspace_participant (Resource)

Manage workspace participants in Seqera Platform.

Workspace participants control access to workspace resources. Each participant
can be an individual organization member (via member_id or email) or an entire
team (via team_id) with a specific role that determines their permissions within
the workspace.

Note: When using email, the lookup to member_id happens once during resource
creation and the participant_id is stored in state for subsequent operations.

Available roles:
- owner: Full control over the workspace
- admin: Administrative access, can manage participants
- maintain: Can modify pipelines and compute environments
- launch: Can launch pipelines
- view: Read-only access (default)

Import formats:
- org_id/workspace_id/email (e.g., "12345/67890/user@example.com")
- org_id/workspace_id/team:team_id (e.g., "12345/67890/team:7405043533023")
- org_id/workspace_id/member:member_id (e.g., "12345/67890/member:98765")

## Example Usage

```terraform
#
# Create an Organization.
#---
resource "seqera_orgs" "example_org" {
  name      = "example-org"
  full_name = "Example Organization"
}

#
# Create a Workspace.
#---
resource "seqera_workspace" "example_workspace" {
  org_id     = seqera_orgs.example_org.org_id
  name       = "example-workspace"
  full_name  = "Example Workspace"
  visibility = "PRIVATE"
}

#
# Add a user to the organization.
#---
resource "seqera_organization_member" "user" {
  org_id = seqera_orgs.example_org.org_id
  email  = "user@example.com"
}

#
# Create a team.
#---
resource "seqera_teams" "data_team" {
  org_id = seqera_orgs.example_org.org_id
  name   = "data-team"
}

#
# Add the user to the team.
#---
resource "seqera_team_member" "user_in_team" {
  org_id    = seqera_teams.data_team.org_id
  team_id   = seqera_teams.data_team.team_id
  member_id = seqera_organization_member.user.member_id
}

#
# Example 1: Add an individual user to workspace by email.
# Email lookup happens once during creation, then participant_id is cached in state.
#---
resource "seqera_workspace_participant" "user_by_email" {
  org_id       = seqera_orgs.example_org.org_id
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.example_workspace.id
  email        = "user@example.com"
  role         = "launch"
}

#
# Example 2: Add an individual user to workspace by member_id.
# Uses the member_id directly with no lookup.
#---
resource "seqera_workspace_participant" "user_by_member_id" {
  org_id       = seqera_orgs.example_org.org_id
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.example_workspace.id
  member_id    = seqera_organization_member.user.member_id
  role         = "maintain"
}

#
# Example 3: Add an entire team to workspace.
# All team members receive the specified role.
#---
resource "seqera_workspace_participant" "team_access" {
  org_id       = seqera_orgs.example_org.org_id
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.example_workspace.id
  team_id      = seqera_teams.data_team.team_id
  role         = "admin"
}
```

```shell
#!/bin/bash

#
# Import an existing workspace participant by email.
# Format: org_id/workspace_id/email
#---
terraform import seqera_workspace_participant.user_by_email '12345/67890/user@example.com'

#
# Import an existing workspace participant by member_id.
# Format: org_id/workspace_id/member:member_id
#---
terraform import seqera_workspace_participant.user_by_member_id '12345/67890/member:98765'

#
# Import an existing team participant by team_id.
# Format: org_id/workspace_id/team:team_id
#---
terraform import seqera_workspace_participant.team_access '12345/67890/team:7405043533023'
```
