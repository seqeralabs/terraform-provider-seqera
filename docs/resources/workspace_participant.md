  Manage workspace participant access in Seqera Platform.
  Workspace participants are users or teams who have been granted access to a
  specific workspace within an organization. Participants can have granular
  roles (owner, admin, maintain, launch, connect, view) that determine their
  permissions within the workspace.
  Participants can be added by username/email, or by referencing an existing
  organization member ID or team ID. This enables flexible access control at

# seqera_workspace_participant (Resource)

Manage workspace participant access in Seqera Platform.

Workspace participants are users or teams who have been granted access to a
specific workspace within an organization. Participants can have granular
roles (owner, admin, maintain, launch, connect, view) that determine their
permissions within the workspace.

Participants can be added by username/email, or by referencing an existing
organization member ID or team ID. This enables flexible access control at
the workspace level.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_workspace_participant" "my_workspaceparticipant" {
  member_id          = 1
  participant_id     = 4
  role               = "connect"
  team_id            = 2
  user_name_or_email = "user@example.com"
  workspace_id       = 9
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_workspace_participant.my_seqera_workspace_participant
  id = jsonencode({
    org_id = 0
    workspace_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_workspace_participant.my_seqera_workspace_participant '{"org_id": 0, "workspace_id": 0}'
```
