Manage Tower Agent credentials in Seqera platform using this resource.

Tower Agent credentials store connection IDs for Tower Agent instances that
enable secure communication between the Seqera Platform and compute environments.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Tower Agent Credential Resource Examples
#
# IMPORTANT: Credential names must use only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens.
# No spaces allowed. Use snake_case (my_credential) or kebab-case (my-credential).

# Variable for sensitive credentials
variable "agent_connection_id" {
  description = "Tower Agent connection ID"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

# Example: Basic Tower Agent credentials
resource "seqera_tower_agent_credential" "example" {
  name         = "agent-main"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  connection_id = var.agent_connection_id
}
```

### Nested Schema for `keys`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_tower_agent_credential.my_seqera_tower_agent_credential
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_tower_agent_credential.my_seqera_tower_agent_credential "..."
```
