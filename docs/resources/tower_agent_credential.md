# seqera_tower_agent_credential (Resource)

Manage Tower Agent credentials in Seqera platform using this resource.

Tower Agent credentials store connection IDs for Tower Agent instances that
enable secure communication between the Seqera Platform and compute environments.

**IMPORTANT**: The Tower Agent must be running and online before creating the credential.
Start the agent with your connection ID first, then create the credential resource.
If the agent is not online, you will receive an error: "The agent is not online - You need to run the agent before proceeding".

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "agent_connection_id" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

# IMPORTANT: The Tower Agent must be running and online with this connection_id
# before creating the credential. Start the agent first:
# ./tw-agent <connection_id> -u https://cloud.seqera.io/api --work-dir=/work

resource "seqera_tower_agent_credential" "example" {
  name         = "agent-main"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  connection_id = var.agent_connection_id
  shared        = false
}

resource "seqera_tower_agent_credential" "shared" {
  name         = "agent-shared"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  connection_id = var.agent_connection_id
  shared        = true
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `connection_id` (String) Tower Agent connection ID (required). A unique UUID string used to identify the Tower Agent instance. Generate using random_uuid resource.
- `name` (String) Display name for the credential. Must be 2-99 characters using only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. No spaces allowed. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `shared` (Boolean) When enabled, all workspace users can access the same Tower Agent instance. Default: false
- `workspace_id` (Number) Workspace numeric identifier

### Read-Only

- `credentials_id` (String) Credentials string identifier
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the credential (max 22 characters)
- `provider_type` (String) Cloud provider type (automatically set to "tw-agent"). Default: "tw-agent"; must be "tw-agent"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_tower_agent_credential.my_seqera_tower_agent_credential
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_tower_agent_credential.my_seqera_tower_agent_credential "..."
```
