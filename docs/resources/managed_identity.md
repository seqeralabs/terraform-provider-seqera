# seqera_managed_identity (Resource)

Manage Managed Identities for HPC environments in Seqera Platform.

Managed Identities are organization-level credentials for HPC/grid computing
platforms that enable granular access control for individual workspace users.
Unlike shared SSH credentials where all activities appear under one account,
managed identities link multiple user credentials to a single identity,
preserving each user's identity in system logs and enabling fair resource
allocation through HPC queue policies.

Supported platforms: Altair PBS, IBM LSF, Moab, Slurm, and Univa Grid Engine.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_managed_identity" "my_managedidentity" {
  checked             = false
  host_name           = "slurm.example.com"
  managed_identity_id = 1
  name                = "my-slurm-cluster"
  org_id              = 8
  platform            = "altair-platform"
  port                = 22
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `host_name` (String) Grid host name or IP address
- `name` (String) Display name for the managed identity
- `platform` (String) Grid computing platform type. must be one of ["altair-platform", "lsf-platform", "moab-platform", "slurm-platform", "uge-platform"]
- `port` (Number) Grid connection port

### Optional

- `checked` (Boolean) If deletion of associated Managed Credentials will be blocked by running jobs that depend on them
- `managed_identity_id` (Number) Managed Identity numeric identifier
- `org_id` (Number) Organization numeric identifier

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_managed_identity.my_seqera_managed_identity
  id = jsonencode({
    managed_identity_id = 0
    org_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_managed_identity.my_seqera_managed_identity '{"managed_identity_id": 0, "org_id": 0}'
```
