# seqera_studios (Resource)

Studios is a unified platform where you can host a combination of
container images and compute environments for interactive analysis using
your preferred tools, like JupyterLab, an R-IDE, Visual Studio Code IDEs,
or Xpra remote desktops. Each Studio session is an individual interactive
environment that encapsulates the live environment for dynamic data analysis.

Note:
On Seqera Cloud, the free tier permits only one running Studio session at a time.
To run simultaneous sessions, contact Seqera for a Seqera Cloud Pro license.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_studios" "my_studios" {
  auto_start     = false
  compute_env_id = "compute-env-id"
  configuration = {
    conda_environment = "...my_conda_environment..."
    cpu               = 2
    gpu               = 0
    lifespan_hours    = 2
    memory            = 4096
    mount_data = [
      "..."
    ]
  }
  data_studio_tool_url  = "public.cr.seqera.io/platform/data-studio-jupyter:4.2.5-0.8"
  description           = "Jupyter studio for data analysis and visualization"
  initial_checkpoint_id = 9
  is_private            = true
  label_ids = [
    7
  ]
  name         = "my-jupyter-studio"
  spot         = true
  workspace_id = 9
}
```

### Nested Schema for `configuration`

Optional:

- `conda_environment` (String) Requires replacement if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_studios.my_seqera_studios
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_studios.my_seqera_studios "..."
```
