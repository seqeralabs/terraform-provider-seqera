# seqera_orgs (Resource)

Manage your organization in Seqera platform using this resource.

Organizations are the top-level structure and contain workspaces, members, and teams.
You can create multiple organizations, each of which can contain multiple workspaces
with shared users and resources. This means you can customize and organize the use of
resources while maintaining an access control layer for users associated with a workspace.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Seqera Organizations Resource Examples
#
# Organizations are the top-level structure in Seqera Platform that contain
# workspaces, members, and teams. Organizations provide multi-tenancy, resource
# isolation, and access control.
#
# KEY CONCEPTS:
# - Organizations contain multiple workspaces
# - Each organization has members with roles (owner, member, collaborator)
# - Teams can be created within organizations for group access control
# - Workspaces within an organization can share resources

# Example 1: Basic organization
# Minimal configuration with required fields only

resource "seqera_orgs" "basic" {
  name      = "my-org"
  full_name = "My Organization"
}

# Example 2: Complete organization with all optional fields
# Full metadata including location, website, and description

resource "seqera_orgs" "complete" {
  name        = "biotech-research"
  full_name   = "Biotech Research Institute"
  description = "Organization for genomics and computational biology research"
  location    = "Boston, MA"
  website     = "https://www.biotechresearch.org"
}

# Example 3: Organization with workspaces
# Create an organization and associated workspaces

resource "seqera_orgs" "research" {
  name        = "research-lab"
  full_name   = "Research Laboratory"
  description = "Multi-project research organization"
  location    = "San Francisco, CA"
}

resource "seqera_workspace" "analysis" {
  name        = "analysis-workspace"
  org_id      = seqera_orgs.research.org_id
  full_name   = "${seqera_orgs.research.name}/analysis-workspace"
  description = "Workspace for data analysis workflows"
  visibility  = "PRIVATE"
}

resource "seqera_workspace" "production" {
  name        = "production-workspace"
  org_id      = seqera_orgs.research.org_id
  full_name   = "${seqera_orgs.research.name}/production-workspace"
  description = "Production workflows"
  visibility  = "PRIVATE"
}

# Example 4: Organization with teams
# Create an organization and teams for access control

resource "seqera_orgs" "enterprise" {
  name      = "enterprise-org"
  full_name = "Enterprise Organization"
}

resource "seqera_teams" "data_science" {
  name        = "data-science"
  description = "Data science team"
  org_id      = seqera_orgs.enterprise.org_id
}

resource "seqera_teams" "devops" {
  name        = "devops"
  description = "DevOps and infrastructure team"
  org_id      = seqera_orgs.enterprise.org_id
}

# Example 5: Multi-environment setup
# Organization with workspaces for different environments

resource "seqera_orgs" "multi_env" {
  name        = "multi-env-org"
  full_name   = "Multi-Environment Organization"
  description = "Organization with dev/staging/prod environments"
}

locals {
  environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
}

resource "seqera_workspace" "environments" {
  for_each = toset(local.environments)

  name        = "${each.value}-workspace"
  org_id      = seqera_orgs.multi_env.org_id
  full_name   = "${seqera_orgs.multi_env.name}/${each.value}-workspace"
  description = "${title(each.value)} environment workspace"
  visibility  = each.value == "prod" ? "PRIVATE" : "SHARED"
}
```

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_orgs.my_seqera_orgs
  id = 0
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_orgs.my_seqera_orgs 0
```
