# seqera_ssh_credential (Resource)

Manage SSH credentials in Seqera platform using this resource. SSH credentials store SSH private keys for secure access to remote compute environments and resources within the Seqera Platform workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "ssh_private_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

variable "ssh_passphrase" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
  default   = ""
}

resource "seqera_ssh_credential" "example" {
  name         = "ssh-main"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  private_key = var.ssh_private_key
  passphrase  = var.ssh_passphrase
}
```

  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_ssh_credential.my_seqera_ssh_credential "..."
```
