# seqera_ssh_credential (Resource)

Manage SSH credentials in Seqera platform using this resource. SSH credentials store SSH private keys for secure access to remote compute environments and resources within the Seqera Platform workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "ssh_private_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

variable "ssh_passphrase" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
  default   = ""
}

resource "seqera_ssh_credential" "example" {
  name         = "ssh-main"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  private_key = var.ssh_private_key
  passphrase  = var.ssh_passphrase
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Display name for the credential. Must be 2-99 characters using only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. No spaces allowed. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `passphrase` (String, Sensitive) Passphrase associated with the SSH private key (optional, sensitive). Leave empty if no passphrase is needed. Requires replacement if changed.
- `workspace_id` (Number) Workspace numeric identifier. Requires replacement if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_ssh_credential.my_seqera_ssh_credential
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_ssh_credential.my_seqera_ssh_credential "..."
```
