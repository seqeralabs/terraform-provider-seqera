# seqera_ssh_credential (Resource)

Manage SSH credentials in Seqera platform using this resource.

SSH credentials store SSH private keys for secure access to remote
compute environments and resources within the Seqera Platform workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# SSH Credential Resource Examples


# Variables for sensitive credentials
variable "ssh_private_key" {
  description = "SSH private key content"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
}

variable "ssh_passphrase" {
  description = "SSH key passphrase (if encrypted)"
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  default     = ""
}

# Example: Basic SSH credentials with private key
resource "seqera_ssh_credential" "example" {
  name         = "ssh-main"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  private_key = var.ssh_private_key
  passphrase  = var.ssh_passphrase  # Optional, only if key is encrypted
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Display name for the credential. Must be 2-99 characters using only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. No spaces allowed. Requires replacement if changed.
- `private_key` (String, Sensitive) SSH private key content (required, sensitive). The content of the private key file from the SSH asymmetrical key pair. Generate with: ssh-keygen

### Optional

- `passphrase` (String, Sensitive) Passphrase associated with the SSH private key (optional, sensitive). Leave empty if no passphrase is needed.
- `workspace_id` (Number) Workspace numeric identifier

### Read-Only

- `credentials_id` (String) Credentials string identifier
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the credential (max 22 characters)
- `keys` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--keys))
- `provider_type` (String) Cloud provider type (automatically set to "ssh"). Default: "ssh"; must be "ssh"

### Nested Schema for `keys`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_ssh_credential.my_seqera_ssh_credential
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_ssh_credential.my_seqera_ssh_credential "..."
```
