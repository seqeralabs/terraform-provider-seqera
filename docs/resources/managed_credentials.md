  Manage individual user SSH credentials for HPC Managed Identities.
  Managed Credentials are user-specific SSH credentials that link to a
  parent Managed Identity. Each credential contains a Linux username and
  SSH private key, enabling individual user authentication to HPC systems
  while maintaining separate user identity in system logs.
  This allows workspace users to access HPC environments with their own
  credentials rather than shared SSH keys, ensuring proper activity tracking,
  fair resource allocation through HPC queue policies, and appropriate
  access control based on individual Linux user permissions.
  Note: All users must belong to the same Linux group with access to the
  HPC work directory for proper file sharing and permissions.

# seqera_managed_credentials (Resource)

Manage individual user SSH credentials for HPC Managed Identities.

Managed Credentials are user-specific SSH credentials that link to a
parent Managed Identity. Each credential contains a Linux username and
SSH private key, enabling individual user authentication to HPC systems
while maintaining separate user identity in system logs.

This allows workspace users to access HPC environments with their own
credentials rather than shared SSH keys, ensuring proper activity tracking,
fair resource allocation through HPC queue policies, and appropriate
access control based on individual Linux user permissions.

Note: All users must belong to the same Linux group with access to the
HPC work directory for proper file sharing and permissions.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_managed_credentials" "my_managedcredentials" {
  checked                = false
  credential_provider    = "ssh"
  managed_credentials_id = 5
  managed_identity_id    = 10
  org_id                 = 10
  user_id                = 5
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `managed_identity_id` (Number) Parent Managed Identity numeric identifier
- `org_id` (Number) Organization numeric identifier

### Optional

- `checked` (Boolean) If Managed Credentials deletion will be blocked by running jobs that depend on them
- `credential_provider` (String) Credential provider type (currently only SSH). Default: "ssh"; must be "ssh"
- `managed_credentials_id` (Number) Managed Credentials numeric identifier
- `user_id` (Number) User numeric identifier

### Read-Only

- `total_size` (Number)
- `user_name` (String) Username for SSH authentication

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_managed_credentials.my_seqera_managed_credentials
  id = jsonencode({
    managed_identity_id = 0
    org_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_managed_credentials.my_seqera_managed_credentials '{"managed_identity_id": 0, "org_id": 0}'
```
