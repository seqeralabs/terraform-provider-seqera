# seqera_workspace (Resource)

Manage workspaces for organizing projects and resources.

Workspaces provide isolated environments for organizing pipelines,
compute environments, and data, with configurable permissions
and access controls for collaborative research projects.

Each user has a unique user workspace to manage resources such as pipelines,
compute environments, and credentials. You can also create multiple workspaces within
an organization context and associate each of these workspaces with dedicated teams of users,
while providing fine-grained access control for each of the teams.

Organization workspaces extend the functionality of user workspaces by adding
the ability to fine-tune access levels for specific members, collaborators, or teams.
This is achieved by managing participants in the organization workspaces.

Organizations consist of members, while workspaces consist of participants.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_workspace" "my_workspace" {
  date_created = "2022-12-28T06:42:48.248Z"
  description  = "Workspace for genomics research projects and computational biology workflows"
  full_name    = "Genomics Research Workspace"
  id           = 1
  last_updated = "2021-06-30T04:32:09.681Z"
  name         = "genomics-research"
  org_id       = 7
  visibility   = "SHARED"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `full_name` (String)
- `name` (String)
- `org_id` (Number) Organization numeric identifier
- `visibility` (String) must be one of ["PRIVATE", "SHARED"]

### Optional

- `date_created` (String) Requires replacement if changed.
- `description` (String) Workspace description
- `id` (Number) Workspace numeric identifier
- `last_updated` (String) Requires replacement if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_workspace.my_seqera_workspace
  id = jsonencode({
    id = 0
    org_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_workspace.my_seqera_workspace '{"id": 0, "org_id": 0}'
```
