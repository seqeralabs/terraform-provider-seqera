# seqera_aws_credential (Resource)

Manage AWS credentials in Seqera platform using this resource.

AWS credentials store authentication information for accessing AWS services
within the Seqera Platform workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# AWS Credential Examples
#
# AWS credentials can be configured in two ways:
# 1. Using access keys (access_key + secret_key)
# 2. Using IAM role assumption (assume_role_arn)

variable "aws_access_key_id" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

variable "aws_secret_access_key" {
  type      = string
  sensitive = true
}

# Example 1: Using access keys
resource "seqera_aws_credential" "with_keys" {
  name         = "aws-with-keys"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  access_key = var.aws_access_key_id
  secret_key = var.aws_secret_access_key
}

# Example 2: Using IAM role assumption
# The Seqera Platform will use ambient AWS credentials to assume this role
resource "seqera_aws_credential" "with_assume_role" {
  name         = "aws-with-role"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  assume_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SeqeraExecutionRole"
}

# Example 3: Using both access keys and role assumption
# The access keys will be used to assume the specified role
resource "seqera_aws_credential" "with_keys_and_role" {
  name         = "aws-with-keys-and-role"
  workspace_id = seqera_workspace.main.id

  access_key      = var.aws_access_key_id
  secret_key      = var.aws_secret_access_key
  assume_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/SeqeraExecutionRole"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Display name for the credential. Must be 2-99 characters using only letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens. No spaces allowed. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `access_key` (String) AWS access key ID. Must start with AKIA (standard) or ASIA (temporary). Required unless assume_role_arn is provided.
- `assume_role_arn` (String) IAM role ARN to assume. Format: arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ROLE_NAME. Either this or both access_key and secret_key must be provided.
- `secret_key` (String, Sensitive) AWS secret access key (sensitive). Must be at least 40 characters. Required unless assume_role_arn is provided.
- `workspace_id` (Number) Workspace numeric identifier. Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the credential (max 22 characters)
- `provider_type` (String) Cloud provider type (automatically set to "aws"). Default: "aws"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_aws_credential.my_seqera_aws_credential
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_aws_credential.my_seqera_aws_credential "..."
```
