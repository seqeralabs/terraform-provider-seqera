# seqera_organization_member (Resource)

Manage organization membership in Seqera Platform.

Organization members are users who have been granted access to an
organization. Members can have different roles (owner, member, collaborator)
that determine their permissions and access levels within the organization.

Adding a member to an organization grants them the ability to access
organization resources based on their assigned role. Members can be added
by username or email address.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_organization_member" "my_organizationmember" {
  member_id = 8
  org_id    = 1
  role      = "owner"
  user      = "user@example.com"
}
```

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_organization_member.my_seqera_organization_member
  id = 0
}
```

terraform import seqera_organization_member.my_seqera_organization_member 0
```
