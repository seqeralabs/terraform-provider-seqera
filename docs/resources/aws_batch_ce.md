## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_aws_batch_ce.my_seqera_aws_batch_ce
  id = jsonencode({
    compute_env_id = "..."
    workspace_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_aws_batch_ce.my_seqera_aws_batch_ce '{"compute_env_id": "...", "workspace_id": 0}'
```
