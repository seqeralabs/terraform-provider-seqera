## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_teams.my_seqera_teams
  id = jsonencode({
    org_id = 0
    team_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_teams.my_seqera_teams '{"org_id": 0, "team_id": 0}'
```
