# seqera_managed_compute_ce (Resource)

Manage Seqera Managed Compute environments in Seqera Platform.

Seqera Managed Compute is a fully managed compute service that handles infrastructure
provisioning and management automatically. Unlike AWS Batch or other compute
environments where you need to configure VPCs, subnets, and IAM roles,
Seqera Managed Compute only requires you to specify the region and instance size.

Key benefits:
- No infrastructure setup required
- Automatic scaling and resource management
- Simplified configuration with just region and instance size

Available instance sizes:
- SMALL: Suitable for lightweight workflows (default)
- MEDIUM: Balanced compute resources
- LARGE: High-performance compute for demanding workflows

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "seqera_managed_compute_ce" "my_managedcomputece" {
  data_retention_policy = true
  environment = [
    {
      compute = true
      head    = false
      name    = "...my_name..."
      value   = "...my_value..."
    }
  ]
  instance_size = "SMALL"
  label_ids = [
    6
  ]
  name            = "...my_name..."
  nextflow_config = "...my_nextflow_config..."
  post_run_script = "...my_post_run_script..."
  pre_run_script  = "...my_pre_run_script..."
  region          = "us-east-1"
  resource_label_ids = [
    1
  ]
  work_dir     = "work"
  workspace_id = 10
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A unique name for this compute environment. Use only alphanumeric, dash, and underscore characters. Requires replacement if changed.
- `region` (String) AWS region for Seqera Managed Compute resources.
Examples: us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2
Requires replacement if changed.
- `workspace_id` (Number) Workspace numeric identifier. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `data_retention_policy` (Boolean) Enable automatic data retention policy.
When enabled, intermediary files are automatically deleted after 28 days.
Default: true; Requires replacement if changed.
- `environment` (Attributes List) Environment variables for the compute environment. Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--environment))
- `instance_size` (String) Size of the compute instance.
- SMALL: Lightweight workflows (default)
- MEDIUM: Balanced compute resources
- LARGE: High-performance compute for demanding workflows
Default: "SMALL"; must be one of ["SMALL", "MEDIUM", "LARGE"]; Requires replacement if changed.
- `label_ids` (List of Number) Requires replacement if changed.
- `nextflow_config` (String) Global Nextflow configuration settings for workflows. Requires replacement if changed.
- `post_run_script` (String) Bash script to run after workflow execution completes. Requires replacement if changed.
- `pre_run_script` (String) Bash script to run before workflow execution begins. Requires replacement if changed.
- `resource_label_ids` (List of Number) List of resource label IDs to associate with this compute environment. Requires replacement if changed.
- `work_dir` (String) Work directory suffix relative to the S3 bucket provisioned by Seqera.
Optional - a default work directory is used if not specified.
Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `compute_env_id` (String) Compute environment string identifier
- `date_created` (String) Timestamp when the compute environment was created
- `deleted` (Boolean) Flag indicating if the compute environment has been deleted
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the compute environment
- `last_updated` (String) Timestamp when the compute environment was last updated
- `last_used` (String) Timestamp when the compute environment was last used
- `org_id` (Number)
- `platform` (String) Platform type for Seqera Managed Compute environment. Default: "seqeracompute-platform"
- `status` (String) Compute environment status

<a id="nestedatt--environment"></a>
### Nested Schema for `environment`

Optional:

- `compute` (Boolean) Whether this environment variable should be applied to compute/worker nodes.
At least one of 'head' or 'compute' must be set to true. Both can be true to target both environments.
Requires replacement if changed.
Default: false; Requires replacement if changed.
- `head` (Boolean) Whether this environment variable should be applied to the head/master node.
At least one of 'head' or 'compute' must be set to true. Both can be true to target both environments.
Requires replacement if changed.
Default: false; Requires replacement if changed.
- `name` (String) Requires replacement if changed.
- `value` (String) Requires replacement if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = seqera_managed_compute_ce.my_seqera_managed_compute_ce
  id = jsonencode({
    compute_env_id = "..."
    workspace_id = 0
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import seqera_managed_compute_ce.my_seqera_managed_compute_ce '{"compute_env_id": "...", "workspace_id": 0}'
```
