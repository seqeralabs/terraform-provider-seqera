# seqera_tokens (Resource)

Manage API access tokens for authentication.

Tokens provide secure API access for programmatic access to platform
resources and services. Use tokens for CI/CD integration, automation
scripts, and external tools.

IMPORTANT: The token value (access_key) is only available immediately
after creation. Store it securely as it cannot be retrieved later.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Token Resource Examples
#
# Tokens provide API access for programmatic authentication to Seqera Platform.
# The token value (access_key) is only available immediately after creation.

# Example 1: Basic token creation
# Create a token for CI/CD pipeline authentication

resource "seqera_tokens" "ci_pipeline" {
  name = "ci-cd-pipeline-token"
}

output "ci_token_value" {
  value     = seqera_tokens.ci_pipeline.access_key
  sensitive = true
}

# Example 2: Token for automation scripts

resource "seqera_tokens" "automation" {
  name = "automation-script-token"
}

# Example 3: Token with descriptive name for team workflows

resource "seqera_tokens" "data_science_team" {
  name = "data-science-team-token"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `name` (String) Display name for the token (1-50 characters). Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

returned when the token is created and cannot be retrieved later.
Store this securely.
- `date_created` (String) Timestamp when the token was created
- `id` (Number) Unique identifier for the token
- `last_used` (String) Timestamp when the token was last used for authentication (null if never used)
- `token` (Attributes) API access token for platform authentication.
Contains the token ID, name, and usage metadata. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--token))
